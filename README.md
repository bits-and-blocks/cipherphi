# CipherPhi

Onchain zakat collection and redistribution on Stellar.

Donors calculate and pay their zakat into a pooled Soroban contract, and can verify from the Stellar ledger, rather than from a server, that their category was distributed to a recipient whose eligibility was signed before the funds moved. Zakat is pooled by construction, so the claim is category-level, and the architecture keeps it that way throughout.

CipherPhi is the onchain layer for the Swiss Zakat Foundation, a federally supervised Swiss foundation collecting and redistributing zakat since its founding deed of 6 July 2021, audited annually and entirely community funded.

## Status

SCF #45 Build Award submission, Open Track, shortlisted for Community Vote. The architecture incorporates the findings of an internal pre-implementation security review.

> Bits & Blocks has published working examples covering the integrations this build depends on. Read more: [bits-and-blocks/stellar-examples](https://github.com/bits-and-blocks/stellar-examples).

## Architecture

CipherPhi is composed of three main Soroban contracts:

- `zakat_pool` holds custody and the per-asset eight-category balances, and has the only two functions that move value.
- `policy` holds the Shariah parameters and computes the allocation.
- `attestation` verifies eligibility signatures.

One contract holds funds; the other two can never move anything, so the components most likely to change are the ones holding no money.

## Stack

- Stellar Soroban, Rust to Wasm on the soroban-sdk 27
- Stellar Asset Contract custody, USDC first with EURC planned
- Privy embedded wallets, with the Stellar Wallets Kit as the named fallback
- Sponsored reserves covering donor accounts and trustlines
- Circle CCTP for native inbound USDC

Planned but not committed:

- Stellar Disbursement Platform for individual-recipient payouts
- SEP-24 anchor for fiat on-ramp
- Tether Gold contingent on Stellar-native issuance
